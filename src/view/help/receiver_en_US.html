            <h1><b>File Receiver</b></h1>
            A tool for automatically download lots<br/>
            of files(attachments) from your email <br/>
            acount.
            <h2><b>Configuration</b></h2>
            To configurate the File Receiver go to<br/>
            the Settings window and select the <br/>
            Receiver tab. <br/>
            You most configurate your<br/>
            IMAP or POP3 host (only<br/>
            IMAP was tested). The IMAP <br/>
            port usually is 993 or 143 <br/>
            and POP3 port usually is 110 <br/>
            or 995. <br/>
            You can select the folder where the <br/>
            Receiver will look for messages, default <br/>
            it is "INBOX". <br/>
            You can define an action to do when the <br/>
            file is received (delete the message, mark <br/>
            it as read, move it to trash or do nothing) <br/>
            the message are not removed until the <br/>
            message list is empty, so be careful <br/>
            with long lists of messages. <br/>
            If you select "move it to trash" <br/>
            and you actually don't have a <br/>
            folder called "trash" it will <br/>
            attempt to create it. <br/>
            <h2><b>Usage</b></h2>

            added, if you want to download readed <br/>
